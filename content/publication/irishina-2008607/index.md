abstract: In this paper we propose and analyse a novel shape-reconstruction technique
  for the early detection of breast cancer from microwave data, which is based on
  a level-set technique. The shape-based approach offers several advantages compared
  to more traditional pixel-based approaches, as, for example, well-defined boundaries
  and the incorporation of an intrinsic regularization (in form of a-priori assumptions
  regarding the general anatomical structures present in the medium) that reduces
  the dimensionality of the inverse problem and thereby stabilizing the reconstruction.
  The level set strategy (which is an implicit representation of the shapes) frees
  us from topological restrictions during this reconstruction process. We present
  numerical results in 2D which demonstrate the performance of our scheme in various
  simulated realistic situations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
