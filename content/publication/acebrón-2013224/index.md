abstract: An efficient numerical method based on a probabilistic representation for
  the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations in the Fourier space has been derived. This
  has been done theoretically for arbitrary dimensional problems, and particularized
  to unidimensional problems for numerical purposes. Such a representation has been
  validated theoretically in the linear regime comparing the solution obtained with
  the classical results of the linear Landau damping.The numerical strategy followed
  requires generating suitable random trees combined with a Padé approximant for approximating
  accurately a given divergent series. Such series are obtained by summing the partial
  contributions to the solution coming from trees with arbitrary number of branches.
  These contributions, coming in general from multi-dimensional definite integrals,
  are efficiently computed by a quasi-Monte Carlo method. It is shown how the accuracy
  of the method can be effectively increased by considering more terms of the series.The
  new representation was used successfully to develop a Probabilistic Domain Decomposition
  method suited for massively parallel computers, which improves the scalability found
  in classical methods. Finally, a few numerical examples based on classical phenomena
  such as the non-linear Landau damping, and the two streaming instability are given,
  illustrating the remarkable performance of the algorithm, when compared the results
  with those obtained using a classical method. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
