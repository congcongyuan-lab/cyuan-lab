abstract: We focus on the application of microwaves for the early detection of breast
  cancer. We investigate the potential of a novel strategy using shapes for modeling
  the tumor in the breast. An inversion using a shape-based model offers several advantages
  like well-defined boundaries and the incorporation of an intrinsic regularization
  that reduces the dimensionality of the inverse problem whereby at the same time
  stabilizing the reconstruction. We explore novel level-set techniques as a means
  to detect the tumor without any initialization of its position and size. We present
  some numerical resonstructions and we compare them with the conventional MUSIC algorithm,
  in particular with respect to the frequency which is used for the investigation.
  We show that for different frequencies these two methods show a different qualitative
  behaviour in the reconstructions.
