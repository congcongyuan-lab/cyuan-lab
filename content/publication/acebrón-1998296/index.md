abstract: 'A two-timescale asymptotic method has been introduced to analyze the multimodal
  mean-field Kuramoto model of oscillator synchronization in the high-frequency limit.
  The method allows to uncouple the probability density in different components corresponding
  to the different peaks of the oscillator frequency distribution. Each component
  evolves towards a stationary state in a comoving frame and the overall order parameter
  can be reconstructed by combining them. Synchronized phases are a combination of
  traveling waves and incoherent solutions depending on parameter values. Our results
  agree very well with direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck
  equation for the probability density. Numerical results have been obtained by finite
  differences and a spectral method in the particular case of bimodal (symmetric and
  asymmetric) frequency distribution with or without external field. We also recover
  in a very easy and intuitive way the only other known analytical results: those
  corresponding to reflection-symmetric bimodal frequency distributions near bifurcation
  points. Copyright © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.'
