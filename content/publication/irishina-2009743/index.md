abstract: In this paper we investigate the performance of a shape-reconstruction technique
  as tested on the 'Marseille data'. This approach, which is based on a level set
  technique, offers several advantages compared to other approaches, as for example
  well-defined boundaries and the incorporation of an intrinsic regularization in
  the form of a priori assumptions regarding the general structures in the medium.
  The level set strategy (which is an implicit representation of the shapes) frees
  us from topological restrictions during this reconstruction process. Our algorithm
  is aiming at, not only detecting the objects, but simultaneously determining their
  approximate locations, sizes and dielectric properties. The numerical experiments
  show the utility of this method. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
