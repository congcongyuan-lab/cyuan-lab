abstract: 'We study light propagation in tissues using the theory of radiative transport.
  In particular, we study the case in which there is both forward-peaked and large-angle
  scattering. Because this combination of the forward-peaked and large-angle scattering
  makes it difficult to solve the radiative transport equation, we present a method
  to construct approximations to study this problem. The delta-Eddington and Fokker-Planck
  approximations are special cases of this general framework. Using this approximation
  method, we derive two new approximations: the Fokker-Planck-Eddington approximation
  and the generalized Fokker-Planck-Eddington approximation. By computing the transmittance
  and reflectance of light by a slab we study the performance of these approximations.
