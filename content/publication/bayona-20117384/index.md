abstract: Radial basis functions (RBFs) have become a popular method for interpolation
  and solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Many types of RBFs used in
  these problems contain a shape parameter, and there is much experimental evidence
  showing that accuracy strongly depends on the value of this shape parameter. In
  this paper, we focus on PDE problems solved with a multiquadric based RBF finite
  difference (RBF-FD) method. We propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal
  value of the shape parameter that minimizes the approximation error. The algorithm
  is based on analytical approximations to the local RBF-FD error derived in [1].
  We show through several examples in 1D and 2D, both with structured and unstructured
  nodes, that very accurate solutions (compared to finite differences) can be achieved
  using the optimal value of the constant shape parameter. Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.
