abstract: We consider the problem of imaging sparse scenes from a few noisy data using
  an ℓ1-minimization approach. This problem can be cast as a linear system of the
  form Ap = b, where A is an N × K measurement matrix. We assume that the dimension
  of the unknown sparse vector p ϵ ℂk is much larger than the dimension of the data
  vector b ϵ ℂN, i.e. K Gt; N. We provide a theoretical framework that allows us to
  examine under what conditions the ℓ1-minimization problem admits a solution that
  is close to the exact one in the presence of noise. Our analysis shows that ℓ1-minimization
  is not robust for imaging with noisy data when high resolution is required. To improve
  the performance of ℓ1-minimization we propose to solve instead the augmented linear
  system [A|C]p = b, where the N × σ matrix C is a noise collector. It is constructed
  so as its column vectors provide a frame on which the noise of the data, a vector
  of dimension N, can be well approximated. Theoretically, the dimension σ of the
  noise collector should be eN which would make its use not practical. However, our
  numerical results illustrate that robust results in the presence of noise can be
  obtained with a large enough number of columns σ ≺∼ 10K. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.
