abstract: In this work we present a novel level set technique for shape reconstruction
  in history matching for reservoirs with two or more kinds of rocks (the so-called
  lithofacies) using stochastic initializations. In the paper we discuss the use of
  sequential Gaussian simulation for the creation of geostatistical initial guesses
  which will then be applied to an earlier introduced level set based shape reconstruction
  algorithm for the history matching problem in reservoir characterization. The shapes
  or regions with sharp interfaces to each other are represented by a level set function
  which needs to be determined from the production data gathered at few locations
  of the reservoir. We present numerical results in 2D which demonstrate that our
  method is able to provide reliable estimates of this structure from these relatively
  few production data even though the topology of the unknown regions is a priori
  unknown. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
