abstract: The oscillatory behavior of unidirectionally coupled overdamped bistable
  systems was studied. It was found that for an oscillating coupled system, the inclusion
  of the subthreshold periodic target signal resulted in the mixing of two or more
  frequencies in nonlinear devices. The frequency mixing was shown by the power spectral
  density response. The subthreshold time-periodic target signal was capable of inducing
  oscillatory behavior. These oscillations are finding application in the detection
  of very weak target signals.
