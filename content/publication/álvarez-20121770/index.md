abstract: We present a new approach for the reconstruction of ischemic regions from
  only a few non-contact intracardiac recordings. Hence, it is desirable to exploit
  the spatio-temporal correlations contained in the data. To this end, we incorporate
  a time-dependent monodomain model of the cardiac electric activity into the inversion
  scheme. In order to take into account the electrophysiological alterations of ischemic
  regions, we also introduce appropriate variations of the model parameters. This
  approach allows us to perform the reconstruction of the affected regions successfully
  using only a few recording sites. The reconstruction process is based on level set
  techniques. Our numerical experiments in a bi-dimensional model of cardiac tissue
  validate our approach. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
