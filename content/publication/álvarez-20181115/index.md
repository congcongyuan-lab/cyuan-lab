abstract: In this paper we present a method that uses radial basis functions to approximate
  the Laplace–Beltrami operator that allows to solve numerically diffusion (and reaction–diffusion)
  equations on smooth, closed surfaces embedded in R3. The novelty of the method is
  in a closed-form formula for the Laplace–Beltrami operator derived in the paper,
  which involve the normal vector and the curvature at a set of points on the surface
  of interest. An advantage of the proposed method is that it does not rely on the
  explicit knowledge of the surface, which can be simply defined by a set of scattered
  nodes. In that case, the surface is represented by a level set function from which
  we can compute the needed normal vectors and the curvature. The formula for the
  Laplace–Beltrami operator is exact for radial basis functions and it also depends
  on the first and second derivatives of these functions at the scattered nodes that
  define the surface. We analyze the converge of the method and we present numerical
  simulations that show its performance. We include an application that arises in
  cardiology. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.
