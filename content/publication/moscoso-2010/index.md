abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the potential and limitations of cross-correlation
  techniques using numerical simulations, and in particular, we intend to show (i)
  an estimate of the Green's function in different configurations and (ii) results
  for passive imaging. This problem seems especially interesting in seismology, nondestructive
  testing, structure health monitoring, and wireless sensor networks. To compute cross
  correlations of the impulse signals collected by the receivers, we consider scattering
  by discrete scatterers to generate impluse responses with targets and without targets.
  We compute the difference of the cross correlations with targets and the cross correlations
  without targets to estimate the backpropagator (Green's function) in the Kirchhoff
  migration functional. The migration functional is essential to compute images of
  targets. We run numerical simulations for different configurations to explore the
  limitations of this cross correlation methodology from the results of passive imaging.
