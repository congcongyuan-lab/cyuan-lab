abstract: A self-consistent microscopic model of sequential tunneling in superlattices
  is employed to investigate self-sustained current oscillations. Current spikes -
  high-frequency modulation due to well-to-well hopping of charge monopole domain
  walls - are naturally reproduced. Moreover, as the contact doping shrinks, the recycling
  and motion of charge dipoles resulting in a lower-frequency oscillatory mode is
  predicted. For low contact doping, this mode dominates and monopole oscillations
  disappear. At intermediate doping, hysteresis between both the oscillatory modes
  may be possible.
