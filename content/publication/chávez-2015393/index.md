abstract: The inverse problem of electrocardiography (IPE) has been formulated in
  different ways in order to non invasively obtain valuable informations about the
  heart condition. Most of the formulations solve the IPE neglecting the dynamic behavior
  of the electrical wave propagation in the heart. In this work we take into account
  this dynamic behavior by constraining the cost function with the monodomain model.
  We use an iterative algorithm combined with a level set formulation and the use
  of a simple phenomenological model. This method has been previously presented to
  localize ischemic regions in a 2D cardiac tissue. In this work, we analyze the performance
  of this method in different 3D geometries. The inverse procedure exploits the spatiotemporal
  correlations contained in the observed data, which is formulated as a parametric
  adjust of a mathematical model that minimizes the misfit between the simulated and
  the observed data. Numerical results over 3D geometries show that the algorithm
  is capable of identifying the position and the size of the ischemic regions. For
  the experiments with a realistic anatomical geometry, we reconstruct the ischemic
  region with roughly a 47% of falsepositive rate and a 13% false-negative rate under
  10% of input noise. The correlation coefficient between the reconstructed ischemic
  region and the ground truth exceeds the value of 0.70). © Springer International
