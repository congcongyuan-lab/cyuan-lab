abstract: We present an ordinary differential equation approach to the analysis of
  algorithms for constructing l 1 minimizing solutions to underdetermined linear systems
  of full rank. It involves a relaxed minimization problem whose minimum is independent
  of the relaxation parameter. An advantage of using the ordinary differential equations
  is that energy methods can be used to prove convergence. The connection to the discrete
  algorithms is provided by the Crandall-Liggett theory of monotone nonlinear semigroups.
  We illustrate the effectiveness of the discrete optimization algorithm in some sparse
  array imaging problems. Â© 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.
