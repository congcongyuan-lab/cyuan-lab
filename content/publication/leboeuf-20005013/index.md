abstract: Results of Landau fluid calculations of ion temperature gradient-driven
  turbulence in cylindrical geometry but which cover the whole plasma cross section
  are reported. A simple gyrofluid model is used which evolves in time equations for
  the ion density or vorticity, the parallel ion velocity, and the ion temperature
  where Landau damping is included through a linear closure relation. Adiabatic electrons
  and the electrostatic approximation are assumed to hold. Linear calculations indicate
  that the growth rates are significantly reduced in the presence of Landau damping.
  Nonlinear single helicity calculations serve to illustrate the spatial localization
  of the turbulence in the presence of Landau damping. Finally nonlinear multiple
  helicity calculations performed with three different values for the ratio of the
  central ion Larmor radius to the plasma minor radius denoted by ρ* exhibit a definite
  linear scaling of all the fluctuation characteristics, such as levels, scale sizes,
  quasilinear profile modifications, self-generated poloidal flows, and heat diffusivities,
  with ρ*. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.
