abstract: Domain decomposition of two-dimensional domains on which boundary-value
  elliptic problems are formulated is accomplished by probabilistic (Monte Carlo)
  as well as by quasi-Monte Carlo methods, generating only a few interfacial values
  and interpolating on them. Continuous approximations for the trace of solution are
  thus obtained, to be used as boundary data for the subproblems. The numerical treatment
  can then proceed by standard deterministic algorithms, separately in each of the
  so obtained subdomains. Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo simulations may naturally
  exploit multiprocessor architectures, leading to parallel computing, as well as
  the ensuing domain decomposition does. The advantages such as scalability obtained
  by increasing the number of processors are shown, both theoretically and experimentally,
  in a number of test examples, and the possibility of using clusters of computers
  (grid computing) is emphasized. © 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
