abstract: The inertial effects on globally coupled oscillators were studied taking
  into account the effects of white noise, inertia, and spread in the natural frequency
  distribution on the oscillators. The linear stability of the incoherent solution
  of the oscillator populations was analyzed. The mode-coupling equations and incoherence
  and bifurcating stationary solutions for the incoherent solution system were determined.
