abstract: The combination of polyharmonic splines (PHS) with high degree polynomials
  (PHS+poly) has recently opened new opportunities for radial basis function generated
  finite difference approximations. The PHS+poly formulation, which relies on a polynomial
  least squares fitting to enforce the local polynomial reproduction property, resembles
  somehow the so-called moving least squares (MLS) method. Although these two meshfree
  approaches are increasingly used nowadays, no direct comparison has been done yet.
  The present study aims to fill this gap, focusing on scattered data interpolation
  and derivative approximation. We first review the MLS approach and show that under
  some mild assumptions PHS+poly can be formulated analogously. Based on heuristic
  perspectives and numerical demonstrations, we then compare their performances in
  1-D and 2-D. One key result is that, as previously found for PHS+poly, MLS can also
  overcome the edge oscillations (Runge’s phenomenon) by simply increasing the stencil
  size for a fixed polynomial degree. This is, however, controlled by a weighted least
  squares fitting which fails for high polynomial degrees. Overall, PHS+poly is found
  to perform superior in terms of accuracy and robustness. © 2019, Springer Science+Business
