abstract: 'Within the framework of Game Theory, there are games where rewards depend
  on the relative rank between contenders rather than their absolute performance.
  We refer to these situations as contests. By relying on the formalism of Tullock
  success functions, we propose a model where two contenders fight in a contest on
  two fronts with different technology levels associated: a front with large resource
  demand and another with lower resource requirements. The parameter of the success
  function in each front determines the resource demand level. Furthermore, the redistribution
  or not of resources after a tie defines two different games. We solve the model
  analytically through the best-response map dynamics, finding a critical threshold
  for the ratio of the resources between contenders that determines the Nash Equilibrium
  basin and, consequently, the peace and fighting regimes. We also perform numerical
  simulations that corroborate and extend these findings. We hope this study will
  be of interest to areas as diverse as economic conflicts and geopolitics. © 2024
