abstract: A method is proposed to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution of
  elliptic problems with discontinuous boundary conditions using both global and local
  meshless collocation methods with multiquadrics as basis functions. It is based
  on the use of special functions which capture the singular behavior near discontinuities
  in boundary conditions. In the case of global collocation, the method consists in
  enlarging the functional space spanned by the RBF basis functions, while in the
  case of local collocation, the method consists in modifying appropriately the problem
  in order to eliminate the singularities from the formulation. Numerical results
  for benchmark problems such as a stationary heat equation in a box (harmonic) and
  Stokes flow in a lid-driven square cavity, show significant improvements in accuracy
  and in compliance with the continuity equation. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
