abstract: An important technique in modern reservoir management is the use of production
  data for the characterization of permeability distributions with more than one lithology
  from production data. A major difficulty which arises in these situations is that
  sharp discontinuities of permeabilities between these lithofacies need to be reconstructed
  at the same time with more smoothly varying profiles inside of them. So far, techniques
  have been developed which recover either the interfaces or a smoothly varying profile,
  but not both of them. Our group has developed recently a novel method for modelling
  and reconstructing geological shapes in reservoirs from production data. This method
  is based on a level set representation of the shapes. In our previous work1,2 we
  have assumed that the permeability distribution in the different regions of the
  reservoirs do not vary significantly such that they can be approximated by a constant
  value which was approximately known from prior information. In this paper we will
  present an extension of this new method which is able to recover at the same time
  the shapes of the different geological regions and variations of the permeability
  distribution in each of these regions. In each step of our new reconstruction technique
  the production data are used in order to calculate an update for the shape of the
  two lithofacies and at the same time a pixel-based correction of the parameter profiles
  inside of these regions. Only one simulation of a two-phase flow simulator and a
  corresponding adjoint simulator are necessary for calculating both updates. In our
  paper we will present numerical results in 2D for realistic situations of a water
  flooding process. We show that our method is able to reconstruct two lithofacies
  of complicated shape and the corresponding permeability distributions simultaneously
  from these production data. Copyright 2006, European Association of Geoscientists
