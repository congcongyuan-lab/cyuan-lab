abstract: 'We examine optical beam propagation and scattering in random media using
  three equations: radiative transfer, Fokker-Planck and Leakeas-Larsen. The Fokker-Planck
  equation gives a good approximation to the radiative transfer equation for foward
  peaked scattering phase functions. The Leakeas-Larsen equation gives an even better
  approximation. The solutions for all three of these equations can be represented
  as expansions in plane wave modes. Using these plane wave modes, we can compute
  solutions to these equations in a stable and efficient way.'
