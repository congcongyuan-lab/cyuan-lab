abstract: The computational aspects of the finite-element method for the elastic wave
  equations are considered. The necessary numerical techniques are analysed from the
  point of view of accuracy, performance and storage requirements when implemented
  in scalar and vector processors with large storage capacity. The method is implemented
  on an IBM 3090 with vector facility. We consider five different time integration
  schemes (explicit and implicit central difference, Houbolt, constant average acceleration
  and Wilson), and in the implicit case, both direct (Gaussian decomposition) and
  iterative (successive over-relaxation, Jacobi semi-iterative, Jacobi conjugate gradient)
  sparse linear system solvers. These solvers are taken from the ITPACK-2C and ESSL
  libraries using in each case the adequate representation scheme; skyline, row-wise
  and compressed diagonal. It is concluded that constant average acceleration and
  explicit central difference are the most adequate integration methods and Jacobi
  conjugate gradient is the most efficient solver.
