abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the resolution and stability properties
  of sparse promoting optimization theories applied to narrow band array imaging of
  localized scatterers. We consider homogeneous and heterogeneous media, and multiple
  and single scattering situations. When the media is homogeneous with strong multiple
  scattering between scatterers, we give a non-iterative formulation to find the locations
  and reflectivities of the scatterers from a nonlinear inverse problem in two steps,
  using either single or multiple illuminations. We further introduce an approach
  that uses the top singular vectors of the response matrix as optimal illuminations,
  which improves the robustness of sparse promoting optimization with respect to additive
  noise. When multiple scattering is negligible, the optimization problem becomes
  linear and can be reduced to a hybrid-ℓ1 method when optimal illuminations are used.
  When the media is random, and the interaction with the unknown inhomogeneities can
  be primarily modeled by wavefront distortions, we address the statistical stability
  of these methods. We analyze the fluctuations of the images obtained with the hybrid-ℓ1
  method, and we show that it is stable with respect to different realizations of
  the random medium provided the imaging array is large enough. We compare the performance
  of the hybrid-ℓ1 method in random media to the widely used Kirchhoff migration and
  the multiple signal classification methods. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in
