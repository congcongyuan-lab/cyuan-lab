abstract: A domain decomposition method is developed for the numerical solution of
  nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations in any space dimension, based
  on the probabilistic representation of solutions as an average of suitable multiplicative
  functionals. Such a direct probabilistic representation requires generating a number
  of random trees, whose role is that of the realizations of stochastic processes
  used in the linear problems. First, only few values of the sought solution inside
  the space-time domain are computed (by a Monte Carlo method on the trees). An interpolation
  is then carried out, in order to approximate interfacial values of the solution
  inside the domain. Thus, a fully decoupled set of sub-problems is obtained. The
  algorithm is suited to massively parallel implementation, enjoying arbitrary scalability
  and fault tolerance properties. Pruning the trees is shown to increase appreciably
  the efficiency of the algorithm. Numerical examples conducted in 2D, including some
  for the KPP equation, are given. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
