abstract: We consider a stochastic model for Duffing oscillators, where the nonlinearity
  and the randomness are scaled in such a way that they interact strongly. A typical
  feature is the appearance of second harmonics effects. An asymptotic statistical
  analysis for these oscillators is performed in the diffusion limit, when a suitable
  absorbing boundary condition is imposed, according to the underlying physical problem.
  The related Fokker-Planck equation has been numerically solved to obtain the first
  two moments of the oscillator's displacement from its rest-position. Dependence
  on the nonlinearity strength and on the location of the absorbing boundary has also
  been investigated. Such results have been compared with those computed solving the
  corresponding stochastic Ito differential equations by a Monte Carlo method, where
  quasi-random sequences of numbers have been efficiently used. © 2005 Society for
