abstract: 'We present a level-set based technique to recover key characteristics of
  a defect or crack (e.g. location, length and shape) in a two-dimensional material
  from boundary electrical measurements. The key feature of this work is to extend
  the usual level-set technique for modeling volumetric objects to very thin objects.
  Two level-set functions are employed: the first one models the location and form
  of the crack, and the second one models its length and connectivity. An efficient
  gradient based method is derived in order to define evolution laws for these two
  level-set functions which minimize the least squares data misfit. Numerical experiments
  show the utility of this method even in the presence of a significant noise level
  in the measurements. A finite element method is used to simulate the electric field
  behavior in the presence of very thin objects. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'
