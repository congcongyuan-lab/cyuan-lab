abstract: We study theoretically light backscattered by tissues using the radiative
  transport equation. In particular we consider a twolayered medium in which a finite
  slab is situated on top of a half space. We solve the one-dimensional problem in
  which a plane wave is incident normally on the top layer and is the only source
  of light. The solution to this problem is obtained formally by imposing continuity
  between the solutions for the upper and lower layers. However, we are interested
  solely in probing the top layer. Assuming that the optical properties in the lower
  layer are known, we remove it from the problem yielding a finite slab problem by
  prescribing an alternate boundary condition. This boundary condition is derived
  using the theory of Green's functions and is exact. Hence, one needs only to solve
  the transport equation in a finite slab using this alternate boundary condition.
  We derive an asymptotic solution for the case when the slab is optically thin. We
  extend these results to the three-dimensional problem using Fourier transforms.
  These results are validated by comparisons with numerical solutions for the entire
  two-layered problem. Â© 2005 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.
