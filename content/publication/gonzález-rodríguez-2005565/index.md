abstract: This paper describes the application of the adjoint method to the history
  matching problem in reservoir engineering. The history matching problem consists
  in adjusting a set of parameters, in this case the permeability distribution, in
  order to match the data obtained with the simulator to the actual production data
  in the reservoir. Several numerical experiments are presented which show that our
  method is able to reconstruct the unknown permeability distribution in a reliable
  and efficient way from synthetic data provided by an independent numerical forward
  modelling code. An efficient and flexible regularization scheme is introduced as
  well, which stabilizes the inversion and enables the reservoir engineer to incorporate
  certain types of prior information into the final result. © 2005 IOP Publishing
