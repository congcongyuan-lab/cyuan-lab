abstract: We derive a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) to analyze the oscillator equations
  describing a nonlinear amplifier, exemplified by a two-junction Superconducting
  Quantum Interference Device (SQUID), in the presence of thermal noise. We show that
  the FPE admits a unique stationary solution and obtain analytical results for several
  parameters ranges. To solve the FPE numerically, we develop an efficient spectral
  method which exploits the periodicity of the probability density. The numerical
  method, combined with the exact solutions, allow us to rapidly explore the noise-mediated
  dynamics as a function of the control parameters.
