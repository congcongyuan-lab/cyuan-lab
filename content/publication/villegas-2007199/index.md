abstract: We present a novel mathematical algorithm for the characterization of non-conventional
  reservoirs which contain regions of low sensitivity. Our algorithm uses a level
  set representation of shapes describing different lithofacies in the reservoir.
  These shapes need to be reconstructed from the production data using a two-phase
  flow model. In order to deal with regions of low sensitivity, topological perturbations
  are applied successively during the reconstruction in these low sensitivity regions,
  and the level set technique will evolve the so created shapes following a gradient
  direction that minimizes the mismatch between the computed and the production data.
  New shapes created at wrong locations tend to disappear gradually, whereas those
  created at locations where a lithofacie is present tend to grow until they approximately
  match the correct boundaries. We will discuss different strategies and present numerical
  results which demonstrate and compare their performances for two realistic 2D test
  cases. Â© de Gruyter 2007.
