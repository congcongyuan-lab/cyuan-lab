abstract: We introduce the one-way radiative transfer equation (RTE) for modeling
  the transmission of a light beam incident normally on a slab composed of a uniform
  forward-peaked scattering medium. Unlike the RTE, which is formulated as a boundary
  value problem, the one-way RTE is formulated as an initial value problem. Consequently,
  the one-way RTE is much easier to solve. We discuss the relation of the one-way
  RTE to the Fokker-Planck, small-angle, and Fermi pencil beam approximations. Then,
  we validate the one-way RTE through systematic comparisons with RTE simulations
  for both the Henyey-Greenstein and screened Rutherford scattering phase functions
  over a broad range of albedo, anisotropy factor, optical thickness, and refractive
  index values. We find that the one-way RTE gives very good approximations for a
  broad range of optical property values for thin to moderately thick media that have
  moderately to sharply forward-peaked scattering. Specifically, we show that the
  error made by the one-way RTE decreases monotonically as the anisotropic factor
  increases and as the albedo increases. On the other hand, the error increases monotonically
  as the optical thickness increases and the refractive index mismatch at the boundary
  increases. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
