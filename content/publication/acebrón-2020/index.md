abstract: We describe a new Monte Carlo method based on a multilevel method for computing
  the action of the resolvent matrix over a vector. The method is based on the numerical
  evaluation of the Laplace transform of the matrix exponential, which is computed
  efficiently using a multilevel Monte Carlo method. Essentially, it requires generating
  suitable random paths which evolve through the indices of the matrix according to
  the probability law of a continuous-time Markov chain governed by the associated
  Laplacian matrix. The convergence of the proposed multilevel method has been discussed,
  and several numerical examples were run to test the performance of the algorithm.
  These examples concern the computation of some metrics of interest in the analysis
  of complex networks, and the numerical solution of a boundary-value problem for
  an elliptic partial differential equation. In addition, the algorithm was conveniently
  parallelized, and the scalability analyzed and compared with the results of other
  existing Monte Carlo method for solving linear algebra systems. © 2020, Springer
