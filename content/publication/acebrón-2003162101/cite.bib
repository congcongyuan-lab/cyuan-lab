 abstract = {Cooperative dynamics in a class of coupled two dimensional oscillators, using two-junction superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was discussed. The extension of a center-manifold reduction for the single oscillator, yielded an oscillation frequency that was directly proportional to the coupling. The underlying frequency of the noisy system was also determined using the classical resonance.},
