abstract: We develop and analyze a quantitative signal subspace imaging method for
  single-frequency array imaging. This method is an extension to multiple signal classification
  which uses (i) the noise subspace to determine the location and support of targets,
  and (ii) the signal subspace to recover quantitative information about the targets.
  For point targets, we are able to recover the complex reflectivity and for an extended
  target under the Born approximation, we are able to recover a scalar quantity that
  is related to the product of the volume and relative dielectric permittivity of
  the target. Our resolution analysis for a point target demonstrates this method
  is capable of achieving exact recovery of the complex reflectivity at subwavelength
  resolution. Additionally, this resolution analysis shows that noise in the data
  effectively acts as a regularization to the imaging functional resulting in a method
  that is surprisingly more robust and effective with noise than without noise. ©
