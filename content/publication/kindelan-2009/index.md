abstract: An RBF meshless method for the solution of the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes
  equations using the streamfunction-vorticity formulation is presented. This approach
  reduces the problem to the solution of a nonlinear biharmonic equation describing
  the stream function. The method is used to compute the solution of the lid-driven
  cavity flow problem for different Reynolds numbers. For the Stokes problem (Re =
  0), the accuracy deteriorates in the neighborhood of the singularities in the two
  upper corners. Enlarging the space spanned by the RBF basis functions with additional
  functions that capture the singular behavior of the solution restores the spectral
  convergence of the RBF method. Â© Civil-Comp Press, 2009.
