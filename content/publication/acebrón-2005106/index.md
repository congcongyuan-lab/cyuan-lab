abstract: A number of features relevant to stochastic dynamical systems, such as moments
  of solutions and first passage times, can be efficiently computed resorting to sequences
  of quasi-random numbers (low-discrepancy sequences). This method represents an alternative
  choice to the use of pseudorandom numbers, provided that a special care is paid
  to keep sufficiently uncorrelated as well as uniform the former sequences. © 2005
