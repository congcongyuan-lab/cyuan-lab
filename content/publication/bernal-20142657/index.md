abstract: We present an algorithm for two-and three-dimensional capacitance analysis
  on multidielectric integrated circuits of arbitrary geometry. Our algorithm is stochastic
  in nature and as such fully parallelizable. It is intended to extract capacitance
  entries directly from a pixelized representation of the integrated circuit (IC),
  which can be produced from a scanning electron microscopy image. Preprocessing and
  monitoring of the capacitance calculation are kept to a minimum, thanks to the use
  of distance maps automatically generated with a fast marching technique. Numerical
  validation of the algorithm shows that the systematic error of the algorithm decreases
  with better resolution of the input image. Those features render the presented algorithm
  well suited for fast prototyping while using the most realistic IC geometry data.
