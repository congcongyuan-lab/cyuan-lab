abstract: 'Finite-difference (FD) schemes for the numerical integration of the wave
  equation are generally designed with one of two criteria: (a) maximize the numerical
  accuracy order (as In the case of conventional FD operators); (b) minimize the simulation
  error of some physical feature of wave propagation (e.g. the dispersion relation)
  within a spectral frequency band (as introduced recently by Holberg). The analysis
  of cost-effectiveness for a required error bound of the second schemes has neglected
  the role played by time discretization in the overall accuracy. In this paper we
  define a computational cost for the numerical solution of wave equations, which
  includes the effect of approximate temporal differencing. For some representative
  schemes based on leap-frog time differencing we provide an optimal operating point
  (time sampling rate and number of grid points per shortest wavelength) which minimizes
  the computational cost for a given error threshold. We also introduce a new method
  for designing optimal operators for staggered schemes. The new FD operators are
  designed and their optimal operating point is found by minimizing the computational
  cost for a prescribed error bound. The cost of the proposed schemes is shown to
  be less than that of known FD operators and compares favorably with pseudo-spectral
  (PS) operators. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness
  of the new operators. Â© 1989 Society of Exploration Geophysicists. All rights reserved.'
