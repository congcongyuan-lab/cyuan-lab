abstract: We review the occurrence of electric-field domains in doped superlattices
  within a discrete drift model. A complete analysis of the construction and stability
  of stationary field profiles having two domains is carried out. As a consequence,
  we can provide a simple analytical estimation for the doping density above which
  stable domains occur. This bound may be useful for the design of superlattices exhibiting
  self-sustained current oscillations. Furthermore we explain why stable domains occur
  in superlattices in contrast to the usual Gunn diode. Â© 1997 The American Physical
