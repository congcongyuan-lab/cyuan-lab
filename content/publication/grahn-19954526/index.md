abstract: Self-sustained current oscillations have been found in doped GaAs-AlAs superlattices
  and are investigated experimentally and theoretically. The electric-field distribution
  in doped superlattices becomes unstable if the carrier density is not sufficiently
  large to form stable domains. The instability results in self-oscillations of the
  current, which are due to an oscillatory motion of the domain boundary in the superlattice.
  A discrete drift model taking into account several regions of negative differential
  velocity and a large electron density clearly establishes the origin of these oscillations.
