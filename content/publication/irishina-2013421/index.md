abstract: In this paper, we study the possibility of using lifetime data to estimate
  the position and orientation of a fluorescent dipole source within a disordered
  medium. The vector Foldy-Lax equations are employed to calculate the interaction
  between the fluorescent source and the scatterers that are modeled as point-scatterers.
  The numerical experiments demonstrate that if good prior knowledge about the positions
  of the scatterers is available, the position and orientation of the dipole source
  can be retrieved from its lifetime data with precision. If there is uncertainty
  about the positions of the scatterers, the dipole source position can be estimated
  within the same level of uncertainty. Â© 2013 Optical Society of America.
