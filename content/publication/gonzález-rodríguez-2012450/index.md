abstract: We combine diffuse optical tomography for detecting and localizing an inhomogeneity
  in a two-layered tissue and diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) for characterizing
  the spectrum of that inhomogeneity. For detecting and localizing an inhomogeneity,
  we reduce the number of unknowns substantially by seeking only the location and
  size of the inhomogeneity. Then, we seek to recover an unknown specific tumor component
  of that inhomogeneity from spectral data. In doing so, we develop a method for distinguishing
  between healthy and tumorous lesions. We demonstrate the utility of this theory
  with numerical simulations. © 2012 Optical Society of America.
