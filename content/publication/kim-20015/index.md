abstract: Using the theory of radiative transfer, we investigate the interaction between
  polarized waves and a multiple scattering medium as functions of the relative index
  of refraction. To study this problem, we consider circularly and linearly polarized
  continuous waves incident upon a medium containing spherical scatterers. With an
  accurate spectral method, we compute the transmitted Stokes parameters through media
  containing different sized scatterers and different indices of refraction. Our numerical
  results show that the circular depolarization length exhibits a strong dependence
  on the relative index of refraction, while the linear depolarization length does
  not. Â© 2001 The American Physical Society.
