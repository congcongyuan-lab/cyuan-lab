abstract: The Laplace transform inversion is a well-known ill-conditioned problem
  and many numerical schemes in literature have investigated how to solve it. In this
  paper, we revise the Gaver-Stehfest method by using polyharmonic splines augmented
  with polynomials to approximate the Laplace transform into the numerical inversion
  formula. Theoretical accuracy bounds for the fitting model are given. Discussions
  on the effectiveness of the inversion algorithm are produced and confirmed by numerical
  experiments about approximation errors and inversion results. Comparisons with an
  existing model are also presented. Â© 2020, Padova University Press. All rights reserved.
