abstract: The numerical approximation of boundary value problems by means of a probabilistic
  representations often has the drawback that the Monte Carlo estimate of the solution
  is substantially biased due to the presence of the domain boundary. We introduce
  a scheme, which we have called the leading-term Monte Carlo regression, which seeks
  to remove that bias by replacing a ’cloud’ of Monte Carlo estimates—carried out
  at different discretization levels—for the usual single Monte Carlo estimate. The
  practical result of our scheme is an acceleration of the Monte Carlo method. Theoretical
  analysis of the proposed scheme, confirmed by numerical experiments, shows that
  the achieved speedup can be well over 100. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media
