abstract: We present an algorithm for coherent diffractive imaging with phaseless
  measurements. It treats the forward model as a combination of coherent and incoherent
  waves. The algorithm reconstructs absorption and phase contrast that quantifies
  the attenuation and the refraction of the waves propagating through an object. It
  requires coherent or partially coherent illuminations, and several detectors to
  record the intensity of the distorted wave that passes through the object under
  inspection. The diversity of illuminations, obtained by putting masks between the
  source and the object, provides enough information for imaging. The computational
  cost of our algorithm is linear in the number of pixels of the image. Therefore,
  it is efficient for high-resolution imaging. Our algorithm guarantees exact recovery
  if the image is sparse for a given basis. Numerical experiments in the setting of
  phaseless diffraction imaging of sparse objects validate the efficiency and the
  precision of the suggested algorithm. Â© 2015 IEEE.
