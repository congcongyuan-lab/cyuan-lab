abstract: We consider the numerical solution of nonlinear elliptic boundary value
  problems with Kansa's method. We derive analytic formulas for the Jacobian and Hessian
  of the resulting nonlinear collocation system and exploit them within the framework
  of the trust-region algorithm. This ansatz is tested on semilinear, quasilinear
  and fully nonlinear elliptic PDEs (including Plateau's problem, Hele–Shaw flow and
  the Monge–Ampère equation) with excellent results. The new approach distinctly outperforms
  previous ones based on linearization or finite-difference Jacobians. © 2016 Elsevier
