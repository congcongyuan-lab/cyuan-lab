abstract: We propose an illumination strategy for interferometric imaging that allows
  for robust depth recovery from intensity-only measurements. For an array with colocated
  sources and receivers, we show that all the possible interferometric data for multiple
  sources, receivers, and frequencies can be recovered from intensity-only measurements
  provided that we have sufficient source location and frequency illumination diversity.
  There is no need for phase reconstruction in this approach. Using interferometric
  imaging methods we show that in homogeneous media there is no loss of resolution
  when imaging with intensities only. If in these imaging methods we reduce incoherence
  by restricting the multifrequency interferometric data to nearby array elements
  and nearby frequencies we obtain robust images in weakly inhomogeneous background
  media with a somewhat reduced resolution. Â© 2017 Society for Industrial and Applied
