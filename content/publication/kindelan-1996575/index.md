abstract: In this note, the onset of the Gunn effect in the classical 1D unipolar
  drift-diffusion model is investigated through a Hopf bifurcation analysis of the
  spontaneous current oscillation. It is found that in the case that the dimensionless
  semiconductor length is of order unity the bifurcation is supercritical, and becomes
  subcritical for dimensionless lengths above a certain critical value.
