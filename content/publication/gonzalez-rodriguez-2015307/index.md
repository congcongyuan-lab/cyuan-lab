abstract: In this paper we describe a numerical algorithm to compute the Laurent expansion
  of the inverse of singularly perturbed matrices. The algorithm is based on the resolvent
  formalism used in complex analysis to study the spectrum of matrices. The input
  of the algorithm are the matrix coefficients of the power series expansion of the
  perturbed matrix. The matrix coefficients of the Laurent expansion of the inverse
  are computed using recursive analytical formulae. We show that the computational
  complexity of the proposed algorithm grows algebraically with the size of the matrix,
  but exponentially with the order of the singularity. We apply this algorithm to
  several matrices that arise in applications. We make special emphasis to interpolation
  problems with radial basis functions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
