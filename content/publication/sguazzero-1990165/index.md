abstract: Known procedures for designing numerical schemes for the integration of
  elastodynamic equations with explicit control over numerical dispersion are reviewed.
  In the literature, the analysis of such schemes has concentrated on the discrete
  space differentiators, and has neglected the role played by time discretization
  in the overall accuracy. In this paper we define a computational cost for a given
  dispersion error bound which fully includes the effect of temporal differencing.
  For some representative schemes based on leap-frog time marching, we provide an
  optimal operating point (time sampling rate and number of grid points per shortest
  wavelength) which minimizes the computational cost for a given dispersion error
  threshold. Based on this notion of cost, we introduce new optimal operators for
  staggered grids. Additionally, we introduce the notion of composite differentiators
  to design still more cost-effective schemes. The cost of the proposed schemes is
  shown to be less than that of known finite difference (FD) operators and compares
  favorably with pseudo-spectral (PS) algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented
  to illustrate the effectiveness of the new operators. Â© 1990.
