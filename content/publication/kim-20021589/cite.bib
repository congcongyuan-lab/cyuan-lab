 abstract = {Using numerical simulations of vector radiative transport, we examine time-resolved backscattering of circularly polarized plane waves normally incident upon a slab containing a random distribution of latex spheres in water. For large spheres the effect of polarization memory occurs a short time after first-order scattering and before depolarization. It is the result of successive near-forward-scattering events that maintain the incident wave's helicity. For moderately large scatterers it exhibits a simple dependence on the anisotropy factor. For larger spheres or those with higher refractive indices, it also depends on complicated angular and polarization characteristics of backscattering given by Mie theory.
