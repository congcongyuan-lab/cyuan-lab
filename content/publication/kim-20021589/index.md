abstract: Using numerical simulations of vector radiative transport, we examine time-resolved
  backscattering of circularly polarized plane waves normally incident upon a slab
  containing a random distribution of latex spheres in water. For large spheres the
  effect of polarization memory occurs a short time after first-order scattering and
  before depolarization. It is the result of successive near-forward-scattering events
  that maintain the incident wave's helicity. For moderately large scatterers it exhibits
  a simple dependence on the anisotropy factor. For larger spheres or those with higher
  refractive indices, it also depends on complicated angular and polarization characteristics
  of backscattering given by Mie theory. Â© 2002 Optical Society of America.
