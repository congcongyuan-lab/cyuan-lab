abstract: Despite its generality and powerful convergence properties, Milstein’s method
  for functionals of spatially bounded stochastic differential equations is widely
  regarded as difficult to implement. This has likely prevented it from being utilised
  in applications. In this paper, we design and analyse in detail one such implementation.
  The presented method turns out to be on par with other, popular schemes in terms
  of computational cost—but with a (nearly) linear weak convergence rate under the
  usual smoothness requirements on coefficients and boundary. Two byproducts of theoretical
  interest are a new, non-standard rank-one update formula, and a connection between
  numerics of bounded diffusions and Eikonal equations. Three examples are worked
  out, confirming the accuracy and robustness of the method. © 2018, Springer Science+Business
