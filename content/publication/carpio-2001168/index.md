abstract: An efficient numerical scheme is described for the solution of certain types
  of nonlinear hyperbolic equations with an integral constraint which are used to
  model the Gunn effect in semiconductors with impurity capture. We analyze the stability
  and convergence properties of the scheme and present the results of numerical simulations.
  Depending on the value of the parameters defining the problem, a great variety of
  solutions are obtained, including periodic recycling of solitary waves and chaotic
  regimes.
