abstract: We present a method to obtain optimal finite difference formulas which maximize
  their frequency range of validity. The optimization is based on the idea of keeping
  an error of interest (dispersion, phase, or group velocities errors) below a given
  threshold for a wavenumber interval as large as possible. To find the weights of
  these optimal finite difference formulas we solve a system of nonlinear equations.
  Furthermore, we give compact formulas for the optimal weights as function of the
  error bound. Several numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the obtained
  finite difference formulas compared to the standard ones. © 2016 Manuel Kindelan
