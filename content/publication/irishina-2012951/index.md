abstract: We show that the source location problem can be solved in a scattering medium
  using the fluorescence lifetime and realistic a priori information. The intrinsic
  ill-posedness of the problem is reduced when the level of scattering increases.
  This work is a proof of principle demonstrating the high potential of quantitative
  lifetime imaging in complex media. Â© 2012 Optical Society of America.
