abstract: We present a method to obtain optimal RBF-FD formulas which maximize their
  frequency range of validity. The optimization is based on the idea of keeping an
  error of interest (dispersion, phase or group velocity errors) below a given threshold
  for a wavenumber interval as large as possible. To find the weights of these optimal
  finite difference formulas we solve an optimization problem. In a previous work
  we developed a method to optimize the frequency range of validity for finite difference
  weights. That method required to solve a system of nonlinear equations with as many
  unknowns as half of the number of weights, which is a very hard task when the number
  of nodes gets large. The current method requires solving an optimization problem
  with only one parameter, which makes finding a global minimum easier, and thus can
  be used for bigger stencils. We also study which of the standard RBF are more appropriate
  for this problem and introduce a new RBF that depends on two parameters. This new
  RBF improves the resulting frequency response of the RBF-FD methods while keeping
  the cost of the optimization problem low. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
