abstract: Self-sustained current oscillations in weakly coupled superlattices are
  studied by means of a self-consistent microscopic model of sequential tunneling,
  naturally including boundary conditions. Well-to-well hopping and recycling of charge
  monopole domain walls produce current spikes—high-frequency modulation—superimposed
  on the oscillation. For highly doped injecting contacts, the self-oscillations are
  due to the dynamics of monopoles. As the contact doping decreases, a lower-frequency
  oscillatory mode due to recycling and motion of charge dipoles is predicted. For
  low contact doping, this mode dominates and monopole oscillations disappear. At
  intermediate doping, both oscillation modes coexist as stable solutions and hysteresis
  between them is possible. © 1999 The American Physical Society.
