abstract: In this work we derive analytical expressions for the weights of Gaussian
  RBF-FD and Gaussian RBF-HFD formulas for some differential operators. These weights
  are used to derive analytical expressions for the leading order approximations to
  the local truncation error in powers of the inter-node distance h and the shape
  parameter ε. We show that for each differential operator, there is a range of values
  of the shape parameter for which RBF-FD formulas and RBF-HFD formulas are significantly
  more accurate than the corresponding standard FD formulas. In fact, very often there
  is an optimal value of the shape parameter ε for which the local error is zero to
  leading order. This value can be easily computed from the analytical expressions
  for the leading order approximations to the local error. Contrary to what is generally
  believed, this value is, to leading order, independent of the internodal distance
  and only dependent on the value of the function and its derivatives at the node.
